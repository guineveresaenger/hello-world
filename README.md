This is really just to maybe get used to using GitHub a bit better

This is me! I like cooking, baking, sewing, knitting, reading fantasy novels (the magic kind, not the sex kind), dancing, playing music, and hiking. Aside from basically being lost and wandering from Pride and Prejudice, I also like coding. I'm learnign and trying to wrap my head around how GitHub works. I'm so excited. This is all new and fun and awesome.
